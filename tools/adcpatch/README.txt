adcpatch - rewrites GT Sport (v1.69) AdHoc scripts for ryGT's offline features

Patched scripts go in <game folder>\patches\scripts\ (same file name as the game's); the renderer
(GTS-005) serves them in place of the originals. Do not distribute the patched .ADC files: they are
built from Polyphony's scripts. Inputs come from the game's volume (GTToolsSharp unpack).

Build: clone https://github.com/Nenkai/GTAdhocToolchain (3fecc2e) next to this folder as
..\GTAdhocToolchain, apply GTAdhocToolchain-exact-roundtrip.patch (symbol ids by name, so an
unchanged script round-trips byte for byte), then `dotnet build -c Release`.
